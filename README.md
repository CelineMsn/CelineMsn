### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ My name is CÃ©line!

**CelineMsn/CelineMsn** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 3 different websites, a weather application/widget and a dictionnary app on React. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to better master REACT, Javascript and starting with Python. 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fun and useful projects! 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding full-time employment in software development.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about why I decided to learn programming.  
- ğŸ“« Contact me at celine.maisonn@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: At only 33yo I have already lived in lots of different counrties (Canada, France, Australia, China...) and lived so many different lives (from International Group Tax Adviser & Director of Operation to Reiki Master and Software developper). I love to learn and explore!
